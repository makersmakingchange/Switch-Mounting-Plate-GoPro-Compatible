# Switch Plate - GoPro Compatible

<!---  SUMMARY A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs.  --->
The Switch Plate - GoPro Compatible is a cost-effective option for mounting assistive switches. The Switch Plate has a flat surface to which an assistive switch can be attached using hook and loop fastener (e.g., VELCRO). The rear portion of the Switch Plate has a GoPro-compatible mounting interface so the mounting plate can be used with commercially available [GoPro](https://gopro.com/en/ca/) mounting accessories. 

This device is comprised of a single 3D printed part. The overall cost of materials is about $1. This does not include the cost of the GoPro-compatible mounting accessory and additional mounting hardware.

The Switch Plate - GoPro Compatible is open assistive technology (OpenAT). Under the terms of the open source licenses, the device may be built, used, and improved upon by anyone.

Last updated: 2024-May-27. 
The latest version is V1.0. This version has been built and is in use with at least one user.
